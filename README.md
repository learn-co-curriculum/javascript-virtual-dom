# Reconciliation in React

## Objectives

1. Explain how React handles DOM updates in a performant manner

## It Is Not a Virtual DOM

Earlier in the history of React, the term "Virtual DOM" was used to
explain how React was able to perform better than the traditional
DOM.

The term 'Virtual DOM' fails to really explain what is happening and may lead to
a misunderstanding of what is happening behind the scenes when React renders.

In this lesson, we're going to briefly review how React handles updates to the
screen. This process is known as Reconciliation

## Updating the DOM

By now, you should already know what the DOM is: a programmatic representation
of the document we see in the browser. In JavaScript applications, DOM elements
can be added and changed with code. It's possible to build highly complex
websites with hundreds or thousands of DOM elements using plain JavaScript.
Maybe more importantly, through the DOM, JavaScript allows us to build highly
interactive webpages that update dynamically without refreshing. This can come
with some challenges, though.

When the DOM updates, the browser recalculates CSS, lays out the DOM tree and
'repaints' the display. This typically happens so fast you barely notice.
However, on a highly interactive website, or on a website where the JavaScript
is updating the DOM excessively, the process of recalculating and repainting
the display can result in noticeably poor performance.

Any time you want your website or app to update without refreshing, you'll
need to update the DOM; there is no avoiding it. However, React has some neat
tricks for being smart about these updates.

## Reconciliation, Briefly

In React, we know that we write components that return JSX elements. These JSX
elements represent DOM elements, and when rendered, become those elements on a
webpage.

During the initial render, React _also_ uses these elements to build a 'tree'
that _represents_ what the DOM currently looks like, referred to as the
**current** tree. When updates are made that would cause a re-render in React, a
_second_ tree, the **workInProgress** tree is created, representing what the DOM
_will_ look like. When all updates are processed, the **workInProgress** tree is
used to update the DOM and the **current** tree is updated to reflect the new
updates.

This is a key part of React's performance optimization - React uses these trees
as an intermediate step between updates within components (like a change of
state) and updates to the DOM. This helps in two ways:

### Grouped Updates

Updates can be grouped together. By waiting until all updates are processed
before committing the **workInProgress** tree to the DOM, excessive repaints are
avoided.

Say, for instance, you have an app with many components, each colored a shade of
blue, and a button, that when pressed, turns all those components to red. When
that button is pressed, React will put together a tree containing all the
components along with their updated properties, _THEN_ commit all the changes to
the DOM at once. This only requires one repaint. Without this design, we could
end up with code that updates the DOM for each individual part of the app, one
repaint for each part.

### Diffing Changes

In addition to grouping updates to the DOM, React can apply a diffing algorithm
to quickly see what specific pieces of DOM _need_ to be updated and how. This
reduces the number of DOM changes that need to be made and lets React be
particular in its updates, improving performance.

In plain JavaScript some DOM changes are better than others in terms of
performance. For example, say you want to add something inside a `ul` in your
DOM. Using `innerHTML` will work:

```js
ul.innerHTML += "<li>A final list item</li>";
```

But this _rebuilds_ the entire DOM inside `div`. On the other hand, using
`appendChild` would _not_ cause a rebuild:

```js
let li = document.createElement("li");
li.textContent = "A final list item";
ul.appendChild(li);
```

React's diffing algorithm is designed to identify changes between what the
current DOM looks like and what it will look like (the **current** and
**workInProgress** trees). Based on the changes it identifies, different
DOM updates will be performed to avoid rebuilding unnecessarily.

A more detailed explanation of the steps of this diffing process can be found
in [React's Reconciliation documentation][reconciliation]

## Conclusion

There are some [misconceptions][1] [floating][2] [around][3] regarding the DOM
being slow, often related to how frameworks like React can improve performance.
While DOM manipulation _itself_ isn't 'slow,' repainting what is displayed in
the browser can be.

React can be very smart about handling DOM updates, which improves performance.
Primarily, it does this in two ways: grouping DOM updates to prevent excessive
repaints and being selective about what specifically needs to update and how.
